# Org-Mode AST Investigation Tool
This repository contains a slapdash tool to make visualizing the abstract syntax tree of an org-mode document easier. Write your org-mode source into the top text box, and below on the right it will create a clickable tree of the AST. When you click on a node, the contents of that node will be highlighted on the left.
