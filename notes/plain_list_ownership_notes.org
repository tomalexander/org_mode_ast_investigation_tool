** Ownership
This table is just showing ownership for the plain list items, not the containing plain list nor the elements inside each item.

| Plain List *Item*      | Owns trailing blank lines |
|------------------------+---------------------------|
| foo (includes bar baz) | Yes                       |
| bar                    | Yes                       |
| baz                    | Yes                       |
| lorem                  | No                        |
** Analysis
In this test case, we see that the only list item that doesn't own its trailing blank lines is "lorem", the final list item of the outer-most list.
* Test 2
We add "cat" as a paragraph at the end of foo which makes "baz" lose its trailing blank lines.

| bar                           | Yes                       |

| lorem                         | No                        |
** Analysis
In isolation, this implies that the final plain list item does not own its trailing blank lines, which conflicts with "baz" from test 1.

New theory: List items own their trailing blank lines unless they are both the final list item and not the final element of a list item.

| Plain List *Item*             | Owns trailing blank lines | Why                                                       |
|-------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| foo -> cat (includes bar baz) | Yes                       | Not the final list item                                   |
| bar                           | Yes                       | Not the final list item                                   |
| baz                           | No                        | Final item of bar->baz and not the final element of "foo" |
| lorem                         | No                        | Final item of foo->lorem and not contained in a list item |
* Test 3
So if that theory is true, taking the entire (foo -> lorem) list from test 1 and nesting it inside a list should coerce "lorem" to own its trailing blank lines since it would then be a final list item (of foo -> lorem) and the final element of the new list.

** Analysis
Against expectations, we did not coerce lorem to consume its trailing blank lines. What is different between "baz" and "lorem"? Well, "baz" is contained within "foo" which has a "lorem" after it, whereas "lorem" is contained within "cat" which does not have any list items after it.

New theory: List items own their trailing blank lines unless they are both the final list item and not the final element of a non-final list item.

| baz                         | Yes                       | Final element of non-final list item                 |
| lorem                       | No                        | Final list item and final element of final list item |
* Test 4
So if that theory is true, then we should be able to coerce lorem to consume its trailing blank lines by adding a second item to the cat list.

For the first time our expectations were met!

Enduring theory: List items own their trailing blank lines unless they are both the final list item and not the final element of a non-final list item.
